//Due to a bug, there are many duplicate folders in a file system. You are given
//a 2D array paths, where paths[i] is an array representing an absolute path to
//the ith folder in the file system.
//For example, ["one", "two", "three"] represents the path "/one/two/three".
//Two folders (not necessarily on the same level) are identical if they contain
//the same non-empty set of identical subfolders and underlying subfolder
//structure. The folders do not need to be at the root level to be identical. If
//two or more folders are identical, then mark the folders as well as all their
//subfolders.
//For example, folders "/a" and "/b" in the file structure below are identical.
//They (as well as their subfolders) should all be marked:
///a
///a/x
///a/x/y
///a/z
///b
///b/x
///b/x/y
///b/z
//However, if the file structure also included the path "/b/w", then the folders
//"/a" and "/b" would not be identical. 
//Note that "/a/x" and "/b/x" would still
//be considered identical even with the added folder.
//Once all the identical folders and their subfolders have been marked, the file
//system will delete all of them. The file system only runs the deletion once, so
//any folders that become identical after the initial deletion are not deleted.
//Return the 2D array ans containing the paths of the remaining folders after
//deleting all the marked folders. The paths may be returned in any order.
// 
//
//Example 1:
//Input: paths = [["a"],["c"],["d"],["a","b"],["c","b"],["d","a"]]
//Output: [["d"],["d","a"]]
//Explanation: The file structure is as shown.
//Folders "/a" and "/c" (and their subfolders) are marked for deletion because
//they both contain an empty
//folder named "b".
//
//Example 2:
//[["a"],["c"],["a","b"],["c","b"],["a","b","x"],["a","b","x","y"],["w"],["w","y"]]
//Output: [["c"],["c","b"],["a"],["a","b"]]
//Explanation: The file structure is as shown. 
//Folders "/a/b/x" and "/w" (and their subfolders) are marked for deletion
//because they both contain an empty folder named "y".
//
//Note that folders "/a" and "/c" are identical after the deletion, but they are
//not deleted because they were not marked beforehand.
//
//Example 3:
//Input: paths = [["a","b"],["c","d"],["c"],["a"]]
//Output: [["c"],["c","d"],["a"],["a","b"]]
//Explanation: All folders are unique in the file system.
//
//Note that the returned array can be in a different order as the order does not
//matter.
// 
//Constraints:
//1 &lt;= paths.length &lt;= 2 * 104
//1 &lt;= paths[i].length &lt;= 500
//1 &lt;= paths[i][j].length &lt;= 10
//1 &lt;= sum(paths[i][j].length) &lt;= 2 * 105
//path[i][j] consists of lowercase English letters.
//No two paths lead to the same folder.
//For any folder not at the root level, its parent folder will also be in the
//input.
