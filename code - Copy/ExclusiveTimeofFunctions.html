//On a single-threaded CPU, we execute a program containing n functions. Each
//function has a unique ID between 0 and n-1.
//Function calls are stored in a call stack: when a function call starts, its ID
//is pushed onto the stack, and when a function call ends, its ID is popped off
//the stack. The function whose ID is at the top of the stack is the current
//function being executed. Each time a function starts or ends, we write a log
//with the ID, whether it started or ended, and the timestamp.
//You are given a list logs, where logs[i] represents the ith log message
//formatted as a string "{function_id}:{"start" | "end"}:{timestamp}". For
//example, "0:start:3" means a function call with function ID 0 started at the
//beginning of timestamp 3, and "1:end:2" means a function call with function ID
//1 ended at the end of timestamp 2. 
//Note that a function can be called multiple
//times, possibly recursively.
//A function's exclusive time is the sum of execution times for all function
//calls in the program. For example, if a function is called twice, one call
//executing for 2 time units and another call executing for 1 time unit, the
//exclusive time is 2 + 1 = 3.
//Return the exclusive time of each function in an array, where the value at the
//ith index represents the exclusive time for the function with ID i.
// 
//
//Example 1:
//Input: n = 2, logs = ["0:start:0","1:start:2","1:end:5","0:end:6"]
//Output: [3,4]
//Explanation:
//Function 0 starts at the beginning of time 0, then it executes 2 for units of
//time and reaches the end of time 1.
//Function 1 starts at the beginning of time 2, executes for 4 units of time, and
//ends at the end of time 5.
//Function 0 resumes execution at the beginning of time 6 and executes for 1 unit
//of time.
//So function 0 spends 2 + 1 = 3 units of total time executing, and function 1
//spends 4 units of total time executing.
//
//Example 2:
//Input: n = 1, logs =
//["0:start:0","0:start:2","0:end:5","0:start:6","0:end:6","0:end:7"]
//Output: [8]
//Explanation:
//Function 0 starts at the beginning of time 0, executes for 2 units of time, and
//recursively calls itself.
//Function 0 (recursive call) starts at the beginning of time 2 and executes for
//4 units of time.
//Function 0 (initial call) resumes execution then immediately calls itself again.
//Function 0 (2nd recursive call) starts at the beginning of time 6 and executes
//for 1 unit of time.
//Function 0 (initial call) resumes execution at the beginning of time 7 and
//executes for 1 unit of time.
//So function 0 spends 2 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 8 units of total time executing.
//
//Example 3:
//Input: n = 2, logs =
//["0:start:0","0:start:2","0:end:5","1:start:6","1:end:6","0:end:7"]
//Output: [7,1]
//Explanation:
//Function 0 starts at the beginning of time 0, executes for 2 units of time, and
//recursively calls itself.
//Function 0 (recursive call) starts at the beginning of time 2 and executes for
//4 units of time.
//Function 0 (initial call) resumes execution then immediately calls function 1.
//Function 1 starts at the beginning of time 6, executes 1 unit of time, and ends
//at the end of time 6.
//Function 0 resumes execution at the beginning of time 6 and executes for 2
//units of time.
//So function 0 spends 2 + 4 + 1 = 7 units of total time executing, and function
//1 spends 1 unit of total time executing.
// 
//Constraints:
//1 &lt;= n &lt;= 100
//1 &lt;= logs.length &lt;= 500
//0 &lt;= function_id &lt; n
//0 &lt;= timestamp &lt;= 109
//No two start events will happen at the same timestamp.
//No two end events will happen at the same timestamp.
//Each function has an "end" log for each "start" log.
