//There are n gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at the
//ith station is gas[i].
//You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs cost[i] of gas to travel
//from the ith station to its next (i + 1)th station. You begin the journey with
//an empty tank at one of the gas stations.
//Given two integer arrays gas and cost, return the starting gas station's index
//if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise
//return -1. If there exists a solution, it is guaranteed to be unique
// 
//
//Example 1:
//Input: gas = [1,2,3,4,5], cost = [3,4,5,1,2]
//Output: 3
//Explanation:
//Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4
//= 4
//Travel to station 4. Your tank = 4 - 1 + 5 = 8
//Travel to station 0. Your tank = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7
//Travel to station 1. Your tank = 7 - 3 + 2 = 6
//Travel to station 2. Your tank = 6 - 4 + 3 = 5
//Travel to station 3. The cost is 5. Your gas is just enough to travel back to
//station 3.
//Therefore, return 3 as the starting index.
//
//Example 2:
//Input: gas = [2,3,4], cost = [3,4,3]
//Output: -1
//Explanation:
//You can't start at station 0 or 1, as there is not enough gas to travel to the
//next station.
//Let's start at station 2 and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
//Travel to station 0. Your tank = 4 - 3 + 2 = 3
//Travel to station 1. Your tank = 3 - 3 + 3 = 3
//You cannot travel back to station 2, as it requires 4 unit of gas but you only
//have 3.
//Therefore, you can't travel around the circuit once no matter where you start.
// 
//Constraints:
//n == gas.length == cost.length
//1 &lt;= n &lt;= 105
//0 &lt;= gas[i], cost[i] &lt;= 104

//Now you might be wondering even after reaching the end of the array why we are not making any 
//circular tour and after reaching the end we're concluding the result. The main concept is that :-
//Let's suppose we start at the 0'th pump moving on and at the middle we've negative fuel so we'll
//restart our journey from the middle position. Now let's suppose after reaching the end we've some 
//fuel in our tank. We're saying that the middle position will be the starting position. But why
//we're not going back to the middle element ( from where we've started our journey) from the end
//to just check whether it's possible to make circular tour or not? It's because we've already 
//checked previously that it's possible to come from the 0'th index to the middle. So no need to 
//check for the remainig part of the circular tour since it will always be a valid tour.
