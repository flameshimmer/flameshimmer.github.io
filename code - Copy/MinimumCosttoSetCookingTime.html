//A generic microwave supports cooking times for:
//at least 1 second.
//at most 99 minutes and 99 seconds.
//To set the cooking time, you push at most four digits. The microwave normalizes
//what you push as four digits by prepending zeroes. It interprets the first two
//digits as the minutes and the last two digits as the seconds. It then adds them
//up as the cooking time. For example,
//You push 9 5 4 (three digits). It is normalized as 0954 and interpreted as 9
//minutes and 54 seconds.
//You push 0 0 0 8 (four digits). It is interpreted as 0 minutes and 8 seconds.
//You push 8 0 9 0. It is interpreted as 80 minutes and 90 seconds.
//You push 8 1 3 0. It is interpreted as 81 minutes and 30 seconds.
//You are given integers startAt, moveCost, pushCost, and targetSeconds.
//Initially, your finger is on the digit startAt. Moving the finger above any
//specific digit costs moveCost units of fatigue. Pushing the digit below the
//finger once costs pushCost units of fatigue.
//There can be multiple ways to set the microwave to cook for targetSeconds
//seconds but you are interested in the way with the minimum cost.
//Return the minimum cost to set targetSeconds seconds of cooking time.
//Remember that one minute consists of 60 seconds.
// 
//
//Example 1:
//Input: startAt = 1, moveCost = 2, pushCost = 1, targetSeconds = 600
//Output: 6
//Explanation: The following are the possible ways to set the cooking time.
//- 1 0 0 0, interpreted as 10 minutes and 0 seconds.
//  The finger is already on digit 1, pushes 1 (with cost 1), moves to 0 (with
//cost 2), pushes 0 (with cost 1), pushes 0 (with cost 1), and pushes 0 (with
//cost 1).
//  The cost is: 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6. This is the minimum cost.
//- 0 9 6 0, interpreted as 9 minutes and 60 seconds. That is also 600 seconds.
//  The finger moves to 0 (with cost 2), pushes 0 (with cost 1), moves to 9 (with
//cost 2), pushes 9 (with cost 1), moves to 6 (with cost 2), pushes 6 (with cost
//1), moves to 0 (with cost 2), and pushes 0 (with cost 1).
//  The cost is: 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 12.
//- 9 6 0, normalized as 0960 and interpreted as 9 minutes and 60 seconds.
//  The finger moves to 9 (with cost 2), pushes 9 (with cost 1), moves to 6 (with
//cost 2), pushes 6 (with cost 1), moves to 0 (with cost 2), and pushes 0 (with
//cost 1).
//  The cost is: 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 9.
//
//Example 2:
//Input: startAt = 0, moveCost = 1, pushCost = 2, targetSeconds = 76
//Output: 6
//Explanation: The optimal way is to push two digits: 7 6, interpreted as 76
//seconds.
//The finger moves to 7 (with cost 1), pushes 7 (with cost 2), moves to 6 (with
//cost 1), and pushes 6 (with cost 2). The total cost is: 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 6
//
//Note other possible ways are 0076, 076, 0116, and 116, but none of them
//produces the minimum cost.
// 
//Constraints:
//0 &lt;= startAt &lt;= 9
//1 &lt;= moveCost, pushCost &lt;= 105
//1 &lt;= targetSeconds &lt;= 6039
