//You are given a 0-indexed 2D integer array tires where tires[i] = [fi, ri]
//indicates that the ith tire can finish its xth successive lap in fi * ri(x-1)
//seconds.
//For example, if fi = 3 and ri = 2, then the tire would finish its 1st lap in 3
//seconds, its 2nd lap in 3 * 2 = 6 seconds, its 3rd lap in 3 * 22 = 12 seconds,
//etc.
//You are also given an integer changeTime and an integer numLaps.
//The race consists of numLaps laps and you may start the race with any tire. You
//have an unlimited supply of each tire and after every lap, you may change to
//any given tire (including the current tire type) if you wait changeTime seconds.
//Return the minimum time to finish the race.
// 
//
//Example 1:
//Input: tires = [[2,3],[3,4]], changeTime = 5, numLaps = 4
//Output: 21
//Explanation: 
//Lap 1: Start with tire 0 and finish the lap in 2 seconds.
//Lap 2: Continue with tire 0 and finish the lap in 2 * 3 = 6 seconds.
//Lap 3: Change tires to a new tire 0 for 5 seconds and then finish the lap in
//another 2 seconds.
//Lap 4: Continue with tire 0 and finish the lap in 2 * 3 = 6 seconds.
//Total time = 2 + 6 + 5 + 2 + 6 = 21 seconds.
//The minimum time to complete the race is 21 seconds.
//
//Example 2:
//Input: tires = [[1,10],[2,2],[3,4]], changeTime = 6, numLaps = 5
//Output: 25
//Explanation: 
//Lap 1: Start with tire 1 and finish the lap in 2 seconds.
//Lap 2: Continue with tire 1 and finish the lap in 2 * 2 = 4 seconds.
//Lap 3: Change tires to a new tire 1 for 6 seconds and then finish the lap in
//another 2 seconds.
//Lap 4: Continue with tire 1 and finish the lap in 2 * 2 = 4 seconds.
//Lap 5: Change tires to tire 0 for 6 seconds then finish the lap in another 1
//second.
//Total time = 2 + 4 + 6 + 2 + 4 + 6 + 1 = 25 seconds.
//The minimum time to complete the race is 25 seconds. 
// 
//Constraints:
//1 &lt;= tires.length &lt;= 105
//tires[i].length == 2
//1 &lt;= fi, changeTime &lt;= 105
//2 &lt;= ri &lt;= 105
//1 &lt;= numLaps &lt;= 1000
