//You are given two 0-indexed integer arrays servers and tasks of lengths n​​​​​​
//and m​​​​​​ respectively. servers[i] is the weight of the i​​​​​​th​​​​ server,
//and tasks[j] is the time needed to process the j​​​​​​th​​​​ task in seconds.
//Tasks are assigned to the servers using a task queue. Initially, all servers
//are free, and the queue is empty.
//At second j, the jth task is inserted into the queue (starting with the 0th
//task being inserted at second 0). As long as there are free servers and the
//queue is not empty, the task in the front of the queue will be assigned to a
//free server with the smallest weight, and in case of a tie, it is assigned to a
//free server with the smallest index.
//If there are no free servers and the queue is not empty, we wait until a server
//becomes free and immediately assign the next task. If multiple servers become
//free at the same time, then multiple tasks from the queue will be assigned in
//order of insertion following the weight and index priorities above.
//A server that is assigned task j at second t will be free again at second t +
//tasks[j].
//Build an array ans​​​​ of length m, where ans[j] is the index of the server the
//j​​​​​​th task will be assigned to.
//Return the array ans​​​​.
// 
//
//Example 1:
//Input: servers = [3,3,2], tasks = [1,2,3,2,1,2]
//Output: [2,2,0,2,1,2]
//Explanation: Events in chronological order go as follows:
//- At second 0, task 0 is added and processed using server 2 until second 1.
//- At second 1, server 2 becomes free. Task 1 is added and processed using
//server 2 until second 3.
//- At second 2, task 2 is added and processed using server 0 until second 5.
//- At second 3, server 2 becomes free. Task 3 is added and processed using
//server 2 until second 5.
//- At second 4, task 4 is added and processed using server 1 until second 5.
//- At second 5, all servers become free. Task 5 is added and processed using
//server 2 until second 7.
//
//Example 2:
//Input: servers = [5,1,4,3,2], tasks = [2,1,2,4,5,2,1]
//Output: [1,4,1,4,1,3,2]
//Explanation: Events in chronological order go as follows: 
//- At second 0, task 0 is added and processed using server 1 until second 2.
//- At second 1, task 1 is added and processed using server 4 until second 2.
//- At second 2, servers 1 and 4 become free. Task 2 is added and processed using
//server 1 until second 4. 
//- At second 3, task 3 is added and processed using server 4 until second 7.
//- At second 4, server 1 becomes free. Task 4 is added and processed using
//server 1 until second 9. 
//- At second 5, task 5 is added and processed using server 3 until second 7.
//- At second 6, task 6 is added and processed using server 2 until second 7.
// 
//Constraints:
//servers.length == n
//tasks.length == m
//1 &lt;= n, m &lt;= 2 * 105
//1 &lt;= servers[i], tasks[j] &lt;= 2 * 105
