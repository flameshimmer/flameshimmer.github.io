//There are n people in a social group labeled from 0 to n - 1. You are given an
//array logs where logs[i] = [timestampi, xi, yi] indicates that xi and yi will
//be friends at the time timestampi.
//Friendship is symmetric. That means if a is friends with b, then b is friends
//with a. Also, person a is acquainted with a person b if a is friends with b, or
//a is a friend of someone acquainted with b.
//Return the earliest time for which every person became acquainted with every
//other person. If there is no such earliest time, return -1.
// 
//
//Example 1:
//[[20190101,0,1],[20190104,3,4],[20190107,2,3],[20190211,1,5],[20190224,2,4],[20190301,0,3],[20190312,1,2],[20190322,4,5]], n
//= 6
//Output: 20190301
//Explanation: 
//The first event occurs at timestamp = 20190101 and after 0 and 1 become friends
//we have the following friendship groups [0,1], [2], [3], [4], [5].
//The second event occurs at timestamp = 20190104 and after 3 and 4 become
//friends we have the following friendship groups [0,1], [2], [3,4], [5].
//The third event occurs at timestamp = 20190107 and after 2 and 3 become friends
//we have the following friendship groups [0,1], [2,3,4], [5].
//The fourth event occurs at timestamp = 20190211 and after 1 and 5 become
//friends we have the following friendship groups [0,1,5], [2,3,4].
//The fifth event occurs at timestamp = 20190224 and as 2 and 4 are already
//friends anything happens.
//The sixth event occurs at timestamp = 20190301 and after 0 and 3 become friends
//we have that all become friends.
//
//Example 2:
//Input: logs = [[0,2,0],[1,0,1],[3,0,3],[4,1,2],[7,3,1]], n = 4
//Output: 3
// 
//Constraints:
//2 &lt;= n &lt;= 100
//1 &lt;= logs.length &lt;= 104
//logs[i].length == 3
//0 &lt;= timestampi &lt;= 109
//0 &lt;= xi, yi &lt;= n - 1
//xi != yi
//All the values timestampi are unique.
//All the pairs (xi, yi) occur at most one time in the input.
