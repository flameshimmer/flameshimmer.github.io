//There is a long and thin painting that can be represented by a number line. You
//are given a 0-indexed 2D integer array paint of length n, where paint[i] =
//[starti, endi]. This means that on the ith day you need to paint the area
//between starti and endi.
//Painting the same area multiple times will create an uneven painting so you
//only want to paint each area of the painting at most once.
//Return an integer array worklog of length n, where worklog[i] is the amount of
//new area that you painted on the ith day.
// 
//
//Example 1:
//Input: paint = 
[
[1,4],
[4,7],
[5,8]
]
//Output: [3,3,1]
//Explanation:
//On day 0, paint everything between 1 and 4.
//The amount of new area painted on day 0 is 4 - 1 = 3.
//On day 1, paint everything between 4 and 7.
//The amount of new area painted on day 1 is 7 - 4 = 3.
//On day 2, paint everything between 7 and 8.
//Everything between 5 and 7 was already painted on day 1.
//The amount of new area painted on day 2 is 8 - 7 = 1. 
//
//Example 2:
//Input: paint = 
[
[1,4],
[5,8],
[4,7]
]
//Output: [3,3,1]
//Explanation:
//On day 0, paint everything between 1 and 4.
//The amount of new area painted on day 0 is 4 - 1 = 3.
//On day 1, paint everything between 5 and 8.
//The amount of new area painted on day 1 is 8 - 5 = 3.
//On day 2, paint everything between 4 and 5.
//Everything between 5 and 7 was already painted on day 1.
//The amount of new area painted on day 2 is 5 - 4 = 1. 
//
//Example 3:
//Input: paint = 
[
[1,5],
[2,4]
]
//Output: [4,0]
//Explanation:
//On day 0, paint everything between 1 and 5.
//The amount of new area painted on day 0 is 5 - 1 = 4.
//On day 1, paint nothing because everything between 2 and 4 was already painted
//on day 0.
//The amount of new area painted on day 1 is 0.
// 
//Constraints:
//1 &lt;= paint.length &lt;= 105
//paint[i].length == 2
//0 &lt;= starti &lt; endi &lt;= 5 * 104
