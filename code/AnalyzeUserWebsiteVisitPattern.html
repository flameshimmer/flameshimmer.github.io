//You are given two string arrays username and website and an integer array
//timestamp. All the given arrays are of the same length and the tuple
//[username[i], website[i], timestamp[i]] indicates that the user username[i]
//visited the website website[i] at time timestamp[i].
//A pattern is a list of three websites (not necessarily distinct).
//For example, ["home", "away", "love"], ["leetcode", "love", "leetcode"], and
//["luffy", "luffy", "luffy"] are all patterns.
//The score of a pattern is the number of users that visited all the websites in
//the pattern in the same order they appeared in the pattern.
//For example, if the pattern is ["home", "away", "love"], the score is the
//number of users x such that x visited "home" then visited "away" and visited
//"love" after that.
//Similarly, if the pattern is ["leetcode", "love", "leetcode"], the score is the
//number of users x such that x visited "leetcode" then visited "love" and
//visited "leetcode" one more time after that.
//Also, if the pattern is ["luffy", "luffy", "luffy"], the score is the number of
//users x such that x visited "luffy" three different times at different
//timestamps.
//Return the pattern with the largest score. If there is more than one pattern
//with the same largest score, return the lexicographically smallest such pattern.
// 
//
//Example 1:
//Input: username =
//["joe","joe","joe","james","james","james","james","mary","mary","mary"],
//timestamp = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], website =
//["home","about","career","home","cart","maps","home","home","about","career"]
//Output: ["home","about","career"]
//Explanation: The tuples in this example are:
//["joe","home",1],["joe","about",2],["joe","career",3],["james","home",4],["james","cart",5],["james","maps",6],["james","home",7],["mary","home",8],["mary","about",9],
//and ["mary","career",10].
//The pattern ("home", "about", "career") has score 2 (joe and mary).
//The pattern ("home", "cart", "maps") has score 1 (james).
//The pattern ("home", "cart", "home") has score 1 (james).
//The pattern ("home", "maps", "home") has score 1 (james).
//The pattern ("cart", "maps", "home") has score 1 (james).
//The pattern ("home", "home", "home") has score 0 (no user visited home 3 times).
//
//Example 2:
//Input: username = ["ua","ua","ua","ub","ub","ub"], timestamp = [1,2,3,4,5,6],
//website = ["a","b","a","a","b","c"]
//Output: ["a","b","a"]
// 
//Constraints:
//3 &lt;= username.length &lt;= 50
//1 &lt;= username[i].length &lt;= 10
//timestamp.length == username.length
//1 &lt;= timestamp[i] &lt;= 109
//website.length == username.length
//1 &lt;= website[i].length &lt;= 10
//username[i] and website[i] consist of lowercase English letters.
//It is guaranteed that there is at least one user who visited at least three
//websites.
//All the tuples [username[i], timestamp[i], website[i]] are unique.
