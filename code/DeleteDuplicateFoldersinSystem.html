//Due to a bug, there are many duplicate folders in a file system. You are given
//a 2D array paths, where paths[i] is an array representing an absolute path to
//the ith folder in the file system.
//For example, ["one", "two", "three"] represents the path "/one/two/three".
//Two folders (not necessarily on the same level) are identical if they contain
//the same non-empty set of identical subfolders and underlying subfolder
//structure. The folders do not need to be at the root level to be identical. If
//two or more folders are identical, then mark the folders as well as all their
//subfolders.
//For example, folders "/a" and "/b" in the file structure below are identical.
//They (as well as their subfolders) should all be marked:
///a
///a/x
///a/x/y
///a/z
///b
///b/x
///b/x/y
///b/z
//However, if the file structure also included the path "/b/w", then the folders
//"/a" and "/b" would not be identical. 
//Note that "/a/x" and "/b/x" would still
//be considered identical even with the added folder.
//Once all the identical folders and their subfolders have been marked, the file
//system will delete all of them. The file system only runs the deletion once, so
//any folders that become identical after the initial deletion are not deleted.
//Return the 2D array ans containing the paths of the remaining folders after
//deleting all the marked folders. The paths may be returned in any order.
// 
//
//Example 1:
//Input: paths = 
[
["a"],
["c"],
["d"],
["a","b"],
["c","b"],
["d","a"]
]
//Output: 
[
["d"],
["d","a"]
]
//Explanation: The file structure is as shown.
//Folders "/a" and "/c" (and their subfolders) are marked for deletion because
//they both contain an empty
//folder named "b".
//
//Example 2:
//
[
["a"],
["c"],
["a","b"],
["c","b"],
["a","b","x"],
["a","b","x","y"],
["w"],
["w","y"]
]
//Output: 
[
["c"],
["c","b"],
["a"],
["a","b"]
]
//Explanation: The file structure is as shown. 
//Folders "/a/b/x" and "/w" (and their subfolders) are marked for deletion
//because they both contain an empty folder named "y".
//
//Note that folders "/a" and "/c" are identical after the deletion, but they are
//not deleted because they were not marked beforehand.
//
//Example 3:
//Input: paths = 
[
["a","b"],
["c","d"],
["c"],
["a"]
]
//Output: 
[
["c"],
["c","d"],
["a"],
["a","b"]
]
//Explanation: All folders are unique in the file system.
//
//Note that the returned array can be in a different order as the order does not
//matter.
// 
//Constraints:
//1 &lt;= paths.length &lt;= 2 * 104
//1 &lt;= paths[i].length &lt;= 500
//1 &lt;= paths[i][j].length &lt;= 10
//1 &lt;= sum(paths[i][j].length) &lt;= 2 * 105
//path[i][j] consists of lowercase English letters.
//No two paths lead to the same folder.
//For any folder not at the root level, its parent folder will also be in the
//input.

namespace Solution2022
{

	//Build Tree: Build a folder tree based on the paths. The process is similar to
	//the Trie building process.

	//Dedupe: Use post-order traversal to visit all the nodes. If we've seen the
	//subfolder structure before, mark the node as deleted.

	//Generate Paths: DFS to generate the output. We skip the nodes that have been
	//deleted.

	//Update 1: To ensure we visit the subfolders in the same order, changed
	//Node::next to unordered_map to map. 
	//(Testcase:  
[
["a"],
["a","a"],
["a","b"],
["a","b","a"],
["b"],
["b","a"],
["b","a","a"],
["b","b"]
])

	//Update 2: To ensure the subfolder structure string only map to a unique tree
	//structure, changed the encoding to use parenthesis instead, e.g. 
	//(root(firstChild)(secondChild)...). (Testcase: [["r","x"],["r","x",
	//"b"],["r","x","b","a"],["r", "y"],["r","y", "a"],["r","y", "b"],["r"]].)

	//Complexity Analysis
	//Assume N is the number of folders, W is the maximum length of folder name, D is
	//the deepest folder depth, and C is the maximum number of direct child folders.
	//Build Tree: We need to add all the N folders, each of which takes O(DWlogC)
	//time. So overall it takes O(NDWlogC) time, and O(NW) space.
	//Dedupe: We traverse the N folders in post-order. The maximum length of
	//subfolder structure string is roughly O(NW), so each node visit need O(NW) time
	//to check if it's a duplicate. The overall time complexity is O(N^2 * W) and the
	//space complexity is O(N^2 * W).
	//Generate Paths: In the worst case we traverse the N nodes again. Each visit
	//takes O(W) time to update the current path and O(DW) time to update the answer.
	//So overall the time complexity is O(NDW) and space complexity is O(DW) for the

	//temporary path.
