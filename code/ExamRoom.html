//There is an exam room with n seats in a single row labeled from 0 to n - 1.
//When a student enters the room, they must sit in the seat that maximizes the
//distance to the closest person. If there are multiple such seats, they sit in
//the seat with the lowest number. If no one is in the room, then the student
//sits at seat number 0.
//Design a class that simulates the mentioned exam room.
//Implement the ExamRoom class:
//ExamRoom(int n) Initializes the object of the exam room with the number of the
//seats n.
//int seat() Returns the label of the seat at which the next student will set.
//void leave(int p) Indicates that the student sitting at seat p will leave the
//room. It is guaranteed that there will be a student sitting at seat p.
// 
//
//Example 1:
//Input
//["ExamRoom", "seat", "seat", "seat", "seat", "leave", "seat"]
//[[10], [], [], [], [], [4], []]
//Output
//[null, 0, 9, 4, 2, null, 5]
//Explanation
//ExamRoom examRoom = new ExamRoom(10);
//examRoom.seat(); // return 0, no one is in the room, then the student sits at
//seat number 0.
//examRoom.seat(); // return 9, the student sits at the last seat number 9.
//examRoom.seat(); // return 4, the student sits at the last seat number 4.
//examRoom.seat(); // return 2, the student sits at the last seat number 2.
//examRoom.leave(4);
//examRoom.seat(); // return 5, the student sits at the last seat number 5.
// 
//Constraints:
//1 &lt;= n &lt;= 109
//It is guaranteed that there is a student sitting at seat p.
//At most 104 calls will be made to seat and leave.
