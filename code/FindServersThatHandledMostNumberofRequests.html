//You have k servers numbered from 0 to k-1 that are being used to handle
//multiple requests simultaneously. Each server has infinite computational
//capacity but cannot handle more than one request at a time. The requests are
//assigned to servers according to a specific algorithm:
//The ith (0-indexed) request arrives.
//If all servers are busy, the request is dropped (not handled at all).
//If the (i % k)th server is available, assign the request to that server.
//Otherwise, assign the request to the next available server (wrapping around the
//list of servers and starting from 0 if necessary). For example, if the ith
//server is busy, try to assign the request to the (i+1)th server, then the
//(i+2)th server, and so on.
//You are given a strictly increasing array arrival of positive integers, where
//arrival[i] represents the arrival time of the ith request, and another array
//load, where load[i] represents the load of the ith request (the time it takes
//to complete). Your goal is to find the busiest server(s). A server is
//considered busiest if it handled the most number of requests successfully among
//all the servers.
//Return a list containing the IDs (0-indexed) of the busiest server(s). You may
//return the IDs in any order.
// 
//
//Example 1:
//Input: k = 3, arrival = [1,2,3,4,5], load = [5,2,3,3,3] 
//Output: [1] 
//Explanation: 
//All of the servers start out available.
//The first 3 requests are handled by the first 3 servers in order.
//Request 3 comes in. Server 0 is busy, so it's assigned to the next available
//server, which is 1.
//Request 4 comes in. It cannot be handled since all servers are busy, so it is
//dropped.
//Servers 0 and 2 handled one request each, while server 1 handled two requests.
//Hence server 1 is the busiest server.
//
//Example 2:
//Input: k = 3, arrival = [1,2,3,4], load = [1,2,1,2]
//Output: [0]
//Explanation: 
//The first 3 requests are handled by first 3 servers.
//Request 3 comes in. It is handled by server 0 since the server is available.
//Server 0 handled two requests, while servers 1 and 2 handled one request each.
//Hence server 0 is the busiest server.
//
//Example 3:
//Input: k = 3, arrival = [1,2,3], load = [10,12,11]
//Output: [0,1,2]
//Explanation: Each server handles a single request, so they are all considered
//the busiest.
// 
//Constraints:
//1 &lt;= k &lt;= 105
//1 &lt;= arrival.length, load.length &lt;= 105
//arrival.length == load.length
//1 &lt;= arrival[i], load[i] &lt;= 109
//arrival is strictly increasing.
