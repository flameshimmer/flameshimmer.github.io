//You are visiting a farm that has a single row of fruit trees arranged from left
//to right. The trees are represented by an integer array fruits where fruits[i]
//is the type of fruit the ith tree produces.
//You want to collect as much fruit as possible. However, the owner has some
//strict rules that you must follow:
//You only have two baskets, and each basket can only hold a single type of
//fruit. There is no limit on the amount of fruit each basket can hold.
//Starting from any tree of your choice, you must pick exactly one fruit from
//every tree (including the start tree) while moving to the right. The picked
//fruits must fit in one of your baskets.
//Once you reach a tree with fruit that cannot fit in your baskets, you must stop.
//Given the integer array fruits, return the maximum number of fruits you can
//pick.
// 
//
//Example 1:
//Input: fruits = [1,2,1]
//Output: 3
//Explanation: We can pick from all 3 trees.
//
//Example 2:
//Input: fruits = [0,1,2,2]
//Output: 3
//Explanation: We can pick from trees [1,2,2].
//If we had started at the first tree, we would only pick from trees [0,1].
//
//Example 3:
//Input: fruits = [1,2,3,2,2]
//Output: 4
//Explanation: We can pick from trees [2,3,2,2].
//If we had started at the first tree, we would only pick from trees [1,2].
// 
//Constraints:
//1 &lt;= fruits.length &lt;= 105
//0 &lt;= fruits[i] &lt; fruits.length
