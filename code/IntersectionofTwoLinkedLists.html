//Given the heads of two singly linked-lists headA and headB, return the node at
//which the two lists intersect. If the two linked lists have no intersection at
//all, return null.
//For example, the following two linked lists begin to intersect at node c1:
//The test cases are generated such that there are no cycles anywhere in the
//entire linked structure.
//
//Note that the linked lists must retain their original structure after the
//function returns.
//Custom Judge:
//The inputs to the judge are given as follows (your program is not given these
//inputs):
//intersectVal - The value of the node where the intersection occurs. This is 0
//if there is no intersected node.
//listA - The first linked list.
//listB - The second linked list.
//skipA - The number of nodes to skip ahead in listA (starting from the head) to
//get to the intersected node.
//skipB - The number of nodes to skip ahead in listB (starting from the head) to
//get to the intersected node.
//The judge will then create the linked structure based on these inputs and pass
//the two heads, headA and headB to your program. If you correctly return the
//intersected node, then your solution will be accepted.
// 
//
//Example 1:
//Input: intersectVal = 8, listA = [4,1,8,4,5], listB = [5,6,1,8,4,5], skipA = 2,
//skipB = 3
//Output: Intersected at '8'
//Explanation: The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if
//the two lists intersect).
//From the head of A, it reads as [4,1,8,4,5]. From the head of B, it reads as
//[5,6,1,8,4,5]. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3
//nodes before the intersected node in B.
//
//Example 2:
//Input: intersectVal = 2, listA = [1,9,1,2,4], listB = [3,2,4], skipA = 3, skipB
//= 1
//Output: Intersected at '2'
//Explanation: The intersected node's value is 2 (note that this must not be 0 if
//the two lists intersect).
//From the head of A, it reads as [1,9,1,2,4]. From the head of B, it reads as
//[3,2,4]. There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 1 node
//before the intersected node in B.
//
//Example 3:
//Input: intersectVal = 0, listA = [2,6,4], listB = [1,5], skipA = 3, skipB = 2
//Output: No intersection
//Explanation: From the head of A, it reads as [2,6,4]. From the head of B, it
//reads as [1,5]. Since the two lists do not intersect, intersectVal must be 0,
//while skipA and skipB can be arbitrary values.
//Explanation: The two lists do not intersect, so return null.
// 
//Constraints:
//The number of nodes of listA is in the m.
//The number of nodes of listB is in the n.
//1 &lt;= m, n &lt;= 3 * 104
//1 &lt;= Node.val &lt;= 105
//0 &lt;= skipA &lt; m
//0 &lt;= skipB &lt; n
//intersectVal is 0 if listA and listB do not intersect.
//intersectVal == listA[skipA] == listB[skipB] if listA and listB intersect.
// 
//Follow up: Could you write a solution that runs in O(m + n) time and use only
//O(1) memory?
