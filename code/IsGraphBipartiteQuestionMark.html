//There is an undirected graph with n nodes, where each node is numbered between
//0 and n - 1. You are given a 2D array graph, where graph[u] is an array of
//nodes that node u is adjacent to. More formally, for each v in graph[u], there
//is an undirected edge between node u and node v. The graph has the following
//properties:
//There are no self-edges (graph[u] does not contain u).
//There are no parallel edges (graph[u] does not contain duplicate values).
//If v is in graph[u], then u is in graph[v] (the graph is undirected).
//The graph may not be connected, meaning there may be two nodes u and v such
//that there is no path between them.
//A graph is bipartite if the nodes can be partitioned into two independent sets
//A and B such that every edge in the graph connects a node in set A and a node
//in set B.
//Return true if and only if it is bipartite.
// 
//
//Example 1:
//Input: graph = [[1,2,3],[0,2],[0,1,3],[0,2]]
//Output: false
//Explanation: There is no way to partition the nodes into two independent sets
//such that every edge connects a node in one and a node in the other.
//
//Example 2:
//Input: graph = [[1,3],[0,2],[1,3],[0,2]]
//Output: true
//Explanation: We can partition the nodes into two sets: {0, 2} and {1, 3}.
// 
//Constraints:
//graph.length == n
//1 &lt;= n &lt;= 100
//0 &lt;= graph[u].length &lt; n
//0 &lt;= graph[u][i] &lt;= n - 1
//graph[u] does not contain u.
//All the values of graph[u] are unique.
//If graph[u] contains v, then graph[v] contains u.
