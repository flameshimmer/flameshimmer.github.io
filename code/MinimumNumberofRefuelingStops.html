//A car travels from a starting position to a destination which is target miles
//east of the starting position.
//There are gas stations along the way. The gas stations are represented as an
//array stations where stations[i] = [positioni, fueli] indicates that the ith
//gas station is positioni miles east of the starting position and has fueli
//liters of gas.
//The car starts with an infinite tank of gas, which initially has startFuel
//liters of fuel in it. It uses one liter of gas per one mile that it drives.
//When the car reaches a gas station, it may stop and refuel, transferring all
//the gas from the station into the car.
//Return the minimum number of refueling stops the car must make in order to
//reach its destination. If it cannot reach the destination, return -1.
//
//Note that if the car reaches a gas station with 0 fuel left, the car can still
//refuel there. If the car reaches the destination with 0 fuel left, it is still
//considered to have arrived.
// 
//
//Example 1:
//Input: target = 1, startFuel = 1, stations = []
//Output: 0
//Explanation: We can reach the target without refueling.
//
//Example 2:
//Input: target = 100, startFuel = 1, stations = [[10,100]]
//Output: -1
//Explanation: We can not reach the target (or even the first gas station).
//
//Example 3:
//Input: target = 100, startFuel = 10, stations =
//[[10,60],[20,30],[30,30],[60,40]]
//Output: 2
//Explanation: We start with 10 liters of fuel.
//We drive to position 10, expending 10 liters of fuel.  We refuel from 0 liters
//to 60 liters of gas.
//Then, we drive from position 10 to position 60 (expending 50 liters of fuel),
//and refuel from 10 liters to 50 liters of gas.  We then drive to and reach the
//target.
//We made 2 refueling stops along the way, so we return 2.
// 
//Constraints:
//1 &lt;= target, startFuel &lt;= 109
//0 &lt;= stations.length &lt;= 500
//0 &lt;= positioni &lt;= positioni+1 &lt; target
//1 &lt;= fueli &lt; 109
