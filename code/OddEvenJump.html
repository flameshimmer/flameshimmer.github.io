//You are given an integer array arr. From some starting index, you can make a
//series of jumps. The (1st, 3rd, 5th, ...) jumps in the series are called
//odd-numbered jumps, and the (2nd, 4th, 6th, ...) jumps in the series are called
//even-numbered jumps. 
//Note that the jumps are numbered, not the indices.
//You may jump forward from index i to index j (with i &lt; j) in the following way:
//During odd-numbered jumps (i.e., jumps 1, 3, 5, ...), you jump to the index j
//such that arr[i] &lt;= arr[j] and arr[j] is the smallest possible value. If there
//are multiple such indices j, you can only jump to the smallest such index j.
//During even-numbered jumps (i.e., jumps 2, 4, 6, ...), you jump to the index j
//such that arr[i] &gt;= arr[j] and arr[j] is the largest possible value. If there
//are multiple such indices j, you can only jump to the smallest such index j.
//It may be the case that for some index i, there are no legal jumps.
//A starting index is good if, starting from that index, you can reach the end of
//the array (index arr.length - 1) by jumping some number of times (possibly 0 or
//more than once).
//Return the number of good starting indices.
// 
//
//Example 1:
//Input: arr = [10,13,12,14,15]
//Output: 2
//Explanation: 
//From starting index i = 0, we can make our 1st jump to i = 2 (since arr[2] is
//the smallest among arr[1], arr[2], arr[3], arr[4] that is greater or equal to
//arr[0]), then we cannot jump any more.
//From starting index i = 1 and i = 2, we can make our 1st jump to i = 3, then we
//cannot jump any more.
//From starting index i = 3, we can make our 1st jump to i = 4, so we have
//reached the end.
//From starting index i = 4, we have reached the end already.
//In total, there are 2 different starting indices i = 3 and i = 4, where we can
//reach the end with some number of
//jumps.
//
//Example 2:
//Input: arr = [2,3,1,1,4]
//Output: 3
//Explanation: 
//From starting index i = 0, we make jumps to i = 1, i = 2, i = 3:
//During our 1st jump (odd-numbered), we first jump to i = 1 because arr[1] is
//the smallest value in [arr[1], arr[2], arr[3], arr[4]] that is greater than or
//equal to arr[0].
//During our 2nd jump (even-numbered), we jump from i = 1 to i = 2 because arr[2]
//is the largest value in [arr[2], arr[3], arr[4]] that is less than or equal to
//arr[1]. arr[3] is also the largest value, but 2 is a smaller index, so we can
//only jump to i = 2 and not i = 3
//During our 3rd jump (odd-numbered), we jump from i = 2 to i = 3 because arr[3]
//is the smallest value in [arr[3], arr[4]] that is greater than or equal to
//arr[2].
//We can't jump from i = 3 to i = 4, so the starting index i = 0 is not good.
//In a similar manner, we can deduce that:
//From starting index i = 1, we jump to i = 4, so we reach the end.
//From starting index i = 2, we jump to i = 3, and then we can't jump anymore.
//From starting index i = 3, we jump to i = 4, so we reach the end.
//From starting index i = 4, we are already at the end.
//In total, there are 3 different starting indices i = 1, i = 3, and i = 4, where
//we can reach the end with some
//number of jumps.
//
//Example 3:
//Input: arr = [5,1,3,4,2]
//Output: 3
//Explanation: We can reach the end from starting indices 1, 2, and 4.
// 
//Constraints:
//1 &lt;= arr.length &lt;= 2 * 104
//0 &lt;= arr[i] &lt; 105
