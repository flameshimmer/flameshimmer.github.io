//In a special ranking system, each voter gives a rank from highest to lowest to
//all teams participated in the competition.
//The ordering of teams is decided by who received the most position-one votes.
//If two or more teams tie in the first position, we consider the second position
//to resolve the conflict, if they tie again, we continue this process until the
//ties are resolved. If two or more teams are still tied after considering all
//positions, we rank them alphabetically based on their team letter.
//Given an array of strings votes which is the votes of all voters in the ranking
//systems. Sort all teams according to the ranking system described above.
//Return a string of all teams sorted by the ranking system.
// 
//
//Example 1:
//Input: votes = ["ABC","ACB","ABC","ACB","ACB"]
//Output: "ACB"
//Explanation: Team A was ranked first place by 5 voters. No other team was voted
//as first place so team A is the first team.
//Team B was ranked second by 2 voters and was ranked third by 3 voters.
//Team C was ranked second by 3 voters and was ranked third by 2 voters.
//As most of the voters ranked C second, team C is the second team and team B is
//the third.
//
//Example 2:
//Input: votes = ["WXYZ","XYZW"]
//Output: "XWYZ"
//Explanation: X is the winner due to tie-breaking rule. X has same votes as W
//for the first position but X has one vote as second position while W doesn't
//have any votes as second position. 
//
//Example 3:
//Input: votes = ["ZMNAGUEDSJYLBOPHRQICWFXTVK"]
//Output: "ZMNAGUEDSJYLBOPHRQICWFXTVK"
//Explanation: Only one voter so his votes are used for the ranking.
// 
//Constraints:
//1 &lt;= votes.length &lt;= 1000
//1 &lt;= votes[i].length &lt;= 26
//votes[i].length == votes[j].length for 0 &lt;= i, j &lt; votes.length.
//votes[i][j] is an English uppercase letter.
//All characters of votes[i] are unique.
//All the characters that occur in votes[0] also occur in votes[j] where 1 &lt;= j &lt;
//votes.length.
