//Given an m x n matrix board containing 'X' and 'O', capture all regions that
//are 4-directionally surrounded by 'X'.
//A region is captured by flipping all 'O's into 'X's in that surrounded region.
// 
//
//Example 1:
//Input: board =
//[["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","O","X"],["X","X","O","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]
//Output:
//[["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]
//Explanation: Surrounded regions should not be on the border, which means that
//any 'O' on the border of the board are not flipped to 'X'. Any 'O' that is not
//on the border and it is not connected to an 'O' on the border will be flipped
//to 'X'. Two cells are connected if they are adjacent cells connected
//horizontally or vertically.
//
//Example 2:
//Input: board = [["X"]]
//Output: [["X"]]
// 
//Constraints:
//m == board.length
//n == board[i].length
//1 &lt;= m, n &lt;= 200
//board[i][j] is 'X' or 'O'.
