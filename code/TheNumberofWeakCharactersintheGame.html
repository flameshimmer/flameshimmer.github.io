//You are playing a game that contains multiple characters, and each of the
//characters has two main properties: attack and defense. You are given a 2D
//integer array properties where properties[i] = [attacki, defensei] represents
//the properties of the ith character in the game.
//A character is said to be weak if any other character has both attack and
//defense levels strictly greater than this character's attack and defense
//levels. More formally, a character i is said to be weak if there exists another
//character j where attackj &gt; attacki and defensej &gt; defensei.
//Return the number of weak characters.
// 
//
//Example 1:
//Input: properties = [[5,5],[6,3],[3,6]]
//Output: 0
//Explanation: No character has strictly greater attack and defense than the
//other.
//
//Example 2:
//Input: properties = [[2,2],[3,3]]
//Output: 1
//Explanation: The first character is weak because the second character has a
//strictly greater attack and defense.
//
//Example 3:
//Input: properties = [[1,5],[10,4],[4,3]]
//Output: 1
//Explanation: The third character is weak because the second character has a
//strictly greater attack and defense.
// 
//Constraints:
//2 &lt;= properties.length &lt;= 105
//properties[i].length == 2
//1 &lt;= attacki, defensei &lt;= 105
