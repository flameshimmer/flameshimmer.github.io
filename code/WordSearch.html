//Given an m x n grid of characters board and a string word, return true if word
//exists in the grid.
//The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, where
//adjacent cells are horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell
//may not be used more than once.
// 
//
//Example 1:
//Input: board = [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]], word =
//"ABCCED"
//Output: true
//
//Example 2:
//Input: board = [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]], word =
//"SEE"
//Output: true
//
//Example 3:
//Input: board = [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]], word =
//"ABCB"
//Output: false
// 
//Constraints:
//m == board.length
//n = board[i].length
//1 &lt;= m, n &lt;= 6
//1 &lt;= word.length &lt;= 15
//board and word consists of only lowercase and uppercase English letters.
// 
//Follow up: Could you use search pruning to make your solution faster with a
//larger board?

namespace Solution2022
{
	//Follow up
	//vector&lt;vector&lt;int&gt;&gt; test = Now, three pruning steps:
	//If the total number of characters in the board is less than the number of
	//characters in word, then you can obviously return false; immediately.
	//Basically, this is when word wouldn't fit in the board at all.
	//For every character in word, that character must appear in board the same
	//number of times or greater. Basically, the number of occurrences of any
	//character c in board must be &gt;= the number of occurrences of c in word.
	//Adding these two pruning methods reduced my runtime from around 380ms (the
	//original non-pruned program) to 45ms.
	//Not so well-known (I think)
	//Consider word = 'aaaaaaaaaab' and let board have all a except for one b in the
	//lower-right corner. The problem is that when we try finding word from each
	//starting point, we will find a lot of ways to construct aaaaaaaaaa each time,
	//but we will never find that last b until our starting point is close the
	//lower-right corner. For these cases, the non-pruned algorithm will be
	//significantly slower.
	//We can partially optimize these sorts of test cases as follows: find the
	//longest prefix and suffix in word that are each made up of the same character.
	//For example, if word = 'aaaabccc', the longest prefix and suffix are length 4
	//and 3 respectively. If the longest prefix is longer than the longest suffix,
	//then reverse the string. This makes it so that word having a very long prefix
	//is a lot less likely. But in cases where the longest prefix/suffix have very
	//close lengths, this won't really help. But for the LeetCode test data, this
	//seems to generate a large speedup; I was able to get 0ms runtime when I
	//submitted the following solution:;
